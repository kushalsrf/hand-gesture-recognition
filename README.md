# hand-gesture-recognition


With the development of ubiquitous computing, current user interaction approaches with keyboard, mouse and pen are not sufficient. Due to the limitation of these devices the useable command set is also limited. Direct use of hands can be used as an input device for providing natural interaction.


Gesture provides a way for computers to understand human body language. This deals with the goal of interpreting hand gestures via mathematical algorithms and enables humans to interface with the machine (HMI) and interact naturally without any mechanical devices.


“Hand Gesture Recognition Using Camera” is based on concept of Image processing. In recent year there is lot of research on gesture recognition using Kinect sensor on using HD camera, but camera and Kinect sensors are more costly. This project focus on reduce cost and improve robustness of the proposed system using simple web camera. Hand gesture recognition generally involves various stages like video acquisition, background subtraction, feature extraction and gesture recognition. The rationale in background subtraction is detecting the moving objects from the difference between the current frame and a reference frame, often called  the  background image  or  background  model.
